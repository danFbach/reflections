Reflection 28
Finished up humane society a little early today. I am now very confident in my ability to inherit classes and properly use them and elements between the inherited and inheriting class, so that really makes me feel good. In the new project, netflix catalogue system, i plan to use a lot of the new properties we've been taught, including(but not limited to) interfaces, null operators, abstract classes, perhaps generic classes if necessary, custom iterators. I really want to use these new tools and learn how and when to properly use them, i think they will improve my abilities. Getting comfortable with these tools will also make my code more extravagent, efficient and effective in its purpose. Still feel really confident in my future here and the new assignment. Always ready for more.
