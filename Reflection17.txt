Reflection 17
the 2D lists have taught me a lot about nesting and how to structure some kinds of data. I believe there are more important uses for this kind of coding but it was still an important lesson and i learned things i didn't already know. also built the function to recognize if a word has been entered more than once and that was a breeze because i had already built something almost identical when doing a python tutorial, the only difference is applying the c# language and syntax...overall things are going good so far this week and im still adding some things to my robot. da end.
