Reflection 13
Today i missed about half the day to to illness, strep throat, but i was put into the regular group which I am content with, i think it was the proper choice due to the fact that im still struggling with inheritance. But i think that if i spend a day or two on this subject, really practicing and trying to learn as much as i can that i should be able to pick up quite a bit and it should prove to be extremely beneficial.
