Reflection 10
	Over the last few days I have been working hard to complete the Nim and Happy numbers challenges. I have completed both and the code from both looks nice and organized, it's not a mess or confusing, every function is very clear in what its purpose is. The both work perfectly with no glitches or other issues so i'm very proud of that...for the nim project no internet research was needed, however for happy numbers i had to do a pretty good amount of research on lists and what their options are, as well as arguments and parameters...however once i got a good grip on how lists work and how to manipulate them the project began to be pretty easy...this weekend i plan to complete most if not all of the remaining tasks! Gonna ACE that test yo!!!
