Reflection 14 - Thursday, March 17
Brushed up a some stuff today, inheritance, variable stuff, lists...all kinds of stuff but my skills are feeling a lot stronger than they did yesterday. I'm happy to feel confident again, I was feeling uncertain for a few days but feeling much better again! ready to keep moving forward.
