Reflection OCHO!	

Today we are finishing up our project to make a dice game. Built the Ai for the game...i kind of question the complexity of the game.
we have met all of the requirements except...possibly the complexity element. anyways, i think it'll be good.
looking forward to learn some new stuff!!
