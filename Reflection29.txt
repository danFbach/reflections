Reflection 29
Today was a solid day...Earned 100% on my lemonade stand which is a nice confidence booster. One thing i could have done better was to break up my larger functions into more, smaller functions. Keeping in mind for the future that functions should "do one thing and do that thing good." I think following that strategy will result in improved function quality and overall code efficiency/effectiveness. I also need to remember to create an appropriate number of extra classes or objects to store values of different items in. I called an enourmous number of functions in one class in my lemonade stand project because I had a majority of my variables and values stored in that same class. Lots of small, effective functions, use extra classes to store values. Humane society project turned out good in the end, all glitches seem to removed and I used a higher number of smaller, more effective functions and many more of my values were stored in their proper classes instead of a majority of calues stored in one class. So, it seems like, compared to my lemonade stand project, i was more successful in my humane society project were i failed or wasn't as successful in the lemonade stand. So, i definitely improved my coding. As far as the netflix project, I find the directions to be pretty ambiguous so I'm having a difficult time properly interpreting the requriements. I'm making progress regardless, not as fast as I would like to be but making progress none the less. Hope to have the netflix app finished, or close to finished by the end of the day tomorrow...although it isn't due until tuesday, I would like to get it done soon so that I can really grasp the concepts that are at work as well as using some of the other ones outside of this project so that i can use them all at will when I want/need to in future projects.
