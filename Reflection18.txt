Reflection 18 3/23/16
today i finished up some of the problems. the fibbinacci sequence to the Nth shift, and the ridiculous 4th problem, launching youtube from the destructor of a class. I think what I learned from that is how to research intensly. I learned a ridiculous amount about destructors and all of their properties and different things you can do with them. I also learned about the importance of using F12 in order to find more properties to an action. Also the importanceof F11 to "step" through your program and find issues. All in all, a long day in which a lot of time was spent reading articles! But I like reading, so it could have been worse.
