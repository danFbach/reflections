Today I had a few interesting experiences with html/css...to the extent that i know what im doing really well, until i dont. and then it all kind of falls apart.memorizing key commands and as well as other things will prove to be very important not only here but also in other languages, perhaps even be more important in others. While taking the test I came to understand the fact that I don't know tables as well as I had thought and have since spent the last few hours recapping and learning as much as I can about them as well as spending much time practicing. Also had a lecture on the internets infrastructure which was interesting eventhougn much of it I already knew. Finally, tomorrow should be good with java...I'm always ready and excited to learn more.
