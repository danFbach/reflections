Reflection 48
It's been awhile since my last reflection, have been extremely busy working and learning. since my last reflection I have greatly improved my ASP.Net MVC5 skills and knowledge. I built an inventory based website for practive in just about 10 hours which is quite significant progress. Since the conclusion of the ASP.Net project we've been working with SQL, learning the syntax, uses and how to utilize it. It hasn't been easy but I have completed SQLZOO as of today and I feel quite a bit more confident in my abilities. I plan to restart the zoo tomorrow and finish over the weekend in order to ake sure that I truly have a handle decent handle on the language. I will also be practicing some Linq and lambda expression tomorrow and this weekend.
