Reflection 22
----Today I continued working on the lemonade stand. It is complete as far as basic requirements so now im adding additional features. 
----I've added color to make it easier to read, but would like to 'sync up' the colors to further refine the UI. 
----I've added the ability to make your own blend of lemonade but still need to add flavor sensitivity to the customers. 
----Customers also have the ability to tip, all on an individual basis, independant of whether and even their likelihood of them buying lemonade, although they must buy lemonade in order to leave a tip. 
----I spent quite a signigicant amount of time today cleaning my code up, making functions more universal, shortening classes(removing code that wasn't needed and/or reworking functions to make them more efficient.) I was able to remove a significant number of lines by the time i was finished. all classes are now under 100 lines. 
----I've also been able to successfully export and import necessary game data in order to save and reload provious games. I would like to, perhaps, make more than one game saveable, multiple save slots, like an old videogame. That way more than one person can save a game in progress and can finish playing at a later time. 
----Once I accomplish all of those tasks, my next logical step would be enabling multiplayer 1v1 and 1vAI...perhaps even more...1v'n'.
----And if I successfully accomplish all of that within a reasonable amount of time, then is cross-computer/cross-platform, playing multiplayer over a LAN. those are my humble goals. :)
