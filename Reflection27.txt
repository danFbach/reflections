I would say that i now have a firm grasp on how to use inheritance and i'm glad that i do, i think it's a very important tool to have available and the better i am at using that tool the better my code will turn out. learned some new things about working with custom data types and how to make them compatable. all in all im very comfortable with where i am in the class and in the project. I'm feeling confident, excited and empowered.
