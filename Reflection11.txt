Reflection 11
Today i learned that i need to put more effort into studying and I need to make sure that I'm putting in all the effort that I can.
I struggled with lists kind of, but more so it was with doing certain things with lists, analying them in certain ways. I was also 
somewhat overwhelmed by the second question and feel like had i been in a better mood and more energetic i would have been able to 
handle it but because I'm sick and barely got to sleep or study, i just wasn't in the coding mood today and it sucked.
