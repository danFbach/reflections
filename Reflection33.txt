Reflection 33
TODAY, I finished up all of the practice problems except the car dealership because it is like a full project, but I'm making progress quite quickly and should have it finished by or before lunch tomorrow. I'm getting more comfortable with null operators and other "newer" concepts. I breezed through most of these assignments so I'm pretty confident in my skills and studies.
